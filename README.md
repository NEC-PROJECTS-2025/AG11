INTRODUCTION

Soybean leaf infestation is a major concern in agricultural production, significantly affecting crop yield and quality worldwide, especially in regions dependent on soybean farming. Early and accurate detection of leaf infestations is crucial to preventing severe crop damage and ensuring food security. In recent years, Deep Learning-based methods have emerged as effective solutions for plant disease detection. Among them, the VGG19 model, a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), has demonstrated remarkable performance in image classification tasks. By leveraging transfer learning, the VGG19 model can be fine-tuned on soybean leaf images to distinguish between healthy and infested leaves with high accuracy. The use of this approach allows automated and real-time detection, reducing dependency on manual inspections and improving decision-making in pest management. Implementing such AI-driven techniques in precision agriculture can lead to early intervention, reducing yield losses and promoting sustainable farming practices.
